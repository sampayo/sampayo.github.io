Switch between your input sources and output devices.

To install just [download][4] ([or my github][3]) and doble click the *.alfredworkflow file.*

To change your input source type input (it could take a little bit to load your sources), then select the one you desire

The same for the output device, just type output then select your choice

Since I donâ€™t have any audio device or source connected to my laptop only 1 (the default) device and source are shown.

**\*You need to get a Powerpack Alfred License to install extensions**
